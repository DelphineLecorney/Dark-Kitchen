## Creation of an online delivery service for cuisine in teams.  :smirk:
> #### This is an exercise in Becode training. :+1:
> Everyone in the group must contribute and each feature displayed must have been created on a branch named after the feature!
The website needs to be responsive, it needs to work on standard mobile resolution and on computer.
Food should be listed using some sort of card templates and categorize the food to be able to filter it (ex: vegan, comfort food)
We need to create a shopping cartcomponent to display the selected dishes and display the total amount of the delivery as well as a dark modecommutator to switch the design between a lighand a darkmode.

- ðŸ”­ **Project to be completed in 3 days (April 17-18-19, 2023)**  

> We were all 5 in web development training at Becode and we're learning javascript, html, css, scss, sass, DOM....

  

- ðŸ‘¯ **We enjoyed working together, a good understanding and good organization allowed us to "merge" without breaking everything !**  ðŸ‘¯
